# ios_dev_scripts

A few scripts I have created to aid me with iOS development.

These scripts were private for a very long time and I didn't consider open sourcing them until now. For this reason there is no "quick and easy" way to install and use this scripts. Usage and installation instructions are found in each script folder.

Feel free to contribute better scripts and installation instructions.

# Included Scripts

1. AppIconResize: Generate all app icon sizes.
2. png2asset: Generates an icon asset for an icon. Supports left-to-right and right-to-left icons. This project replaces AppIconResize.
3. svg@apng: Converts a SVG image to be used as a gliph for your iOS apps (as UIBarBUttonItems, UITabBarItems, etc).
