# ios_dev_scripts

A few scripts I have created to aid me with iOS developments.

These scripts were private for a very long time and I didn't consider open sourcing them until now. For this reason there is no "quick and easy" way to install and use this scripts. Usage and installation instructions are found in each script folder.

Feel free to contribute better scripts and installation instructions.
